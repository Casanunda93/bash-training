Every command in the linux system has an exit status. 
The exit status is an integer. 
It is 0 if a command is executed successfully. 
It is non-0 if a command is executed unsuccessfully. 

To access the exit status of a comman we use:
$?
e.g. We run a command that we want to check the ES of, then we run:
echo $?

To access the manual for information about a specific command:
man <command>

Here we can see specific info about Exit statuses

Exit status can be useful for functions within shell scripting. 



Sometimes you may find that you are running the same chunk of code over and over within a shell script. 
In order to streamline the process, you can use functions to replace having to copy the same chunk over and over. 

the syntax for functions is:

<function-name>(){code-block}

this way we can write the function name elsewhere in the code and have it run the code block.

For example say we want to repeatedly tell the user the date and time followed by a small message. 
We can create a function called mydate to replace the codeblock:

mydate(){
    echo "today is: "
    date
    echo "Have a Great Day"
}

Then when we want to run the function we just write the line: mydate

The important thing about functions is that they also take input

For instance, say we wanted a simple bit of code that spits out a welcome message after someone enters their name, we might want to run this code block for multiple name entries. The following example is a greetings form asking for "Your name" and "Your Wife's name":



#! /bin/bash  

read -p "Please Enter Your First Name: " F                          #Print the quotation and then store the following input as variable F
echo "----------------------"

read -p "Please Enter Your Original Surname: " S                    #Print the quotation and then store the following input as variable S
echo "----------------------"

hello2(){                                                           #Function name: hello2
    echo "First Name: $1 "                                          #Echos first parameter given to function at point of running
    echo "Surname: $2 "                                             #Echos second parameter given to function at point of running
    echo "Greetings $1 $2 "                                         #Echos both parameters given to function at point of running
}

hello2 $F $S                                                        #Runs function setting variable F as parameter 1 and variable S as parameter 2

echo "*********************************************"

read -p "Please Enter Your Wife's First Name: " WF                  #Print the quotation and then store the following input as variable WF  
echo "----------------------"

read -p "Please Enter Your Wife's Original Surname: " WS            #Print the quotation and then store the following input as variable WS       
echo "----------------------"

hello2 $WF $WS                                                      #Runs function setting variable WF as parameter 1 and variable WS as parameter 2



Functions also return an exit status value via $?
This can be deliberately set to a specific value rather than just 0:
return <integer/value>                                              #Sets the exit status to the specified value

This is helpful in situations where we need to say return this value if this case or another value in a different case (else if functions)

Variables inside created functions are global unless specified meaning that even if you set a variable inside a created function, that variable is known throughout the script

if you want to make variable only known inside the function we have to make it a local variable:

local var1="Eggs"                                                   #Sets var1 as a local variable and populates it with "eggs"

*** IT IS GOOD PRACTISE TO SET ALL VARIABLES IN A FUNCTION AS LOCAL VARIABLES TO HELP PREVENT ERRORS ***

As we can see, rather than having to write the code block out twice, we can reference hello2 twice instead with different inputs
