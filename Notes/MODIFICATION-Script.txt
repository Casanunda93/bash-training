The Modification Script:


Arrays

An array is a variable that holds more than one value at a time. 
Think of them as tables e.g. a 2D array is like a spreadsheet. 

In Bash, an array is limited to 1D. 
Think of it as just a row of elements.

Every element of an array is accessed using an address called an index.
Arrays are a somewhat recent update to unix. 

Say we want to create an array called "a" and populate the following values:
"ball", "glass", 22, "pencil"

To do this we run the following:

<array-name>[index]=value

i.e.
a[0]="ball"
a[1]="glass"
a[2]=22
a[3]="pencil"

if we wanted to echo out any of these values:

echo ${a[0]}                    #input
ball                            #output

if we wanted to populate an array in a more efficient way:

<array-name>=(value1, value2, value3)

e.g.
days=(mon tue wed thurs fri)                #stores the days of the week in array day starting at index 0
echo ${days[0]}                             #input
mon                                         #output
echo ${days[3]}                             #input
thurs                                       #output

Populating an array in the above manner always sets the index to 0 for the first value

We can always change the value of any array element, for example if we wanted to make the fourth element (index 3) of the above array "Sun":
days[3]=Sun
echo ${days[3]}                             #input
sun                                         #output

a common way of accessing array elements is via for loop:

Example

#! /bin/bash

days=(mon tue wed thu fri)                  #array named days, populated with days of the week

for i in {0..4}; do                         #for loop, i starts at 0, loops up to 4
    echo "element $i is ${days[i]}          #echo value of i (index) and the element (value) of the array with the index value i
done 


element 0 is mon                            #output
element 1 is tue
element 2 is wed
element 3 is thu
element 4 is fri


if you wanted to see all the elements of an array in one line you could instead run:

echo ${days[@]}                             #input
mon tue wed thu fri                         #output

Using that above syntax, we can run a different for loop to access each element in an array

for element in ${days[@]}; do               #for loop, variable "element" access each value in the array
    echo "This element is $element"         #echo the value of variable "element"
done


In the above example, each element of the array is accessed and echoed, but unlike the first for loop each elements' index is not displayed


If we wanted to know the number of elements in an array:

days=(mon tue wed thu fri)                  #array named days, populated with days of the week
echo ${#days[@]}                            #input
5                                           #output

Again, note in the above that the number of elements is 5, but the array is populated starting at index 0. 

Indexing can pose a headache. 
For example, we can give any index in an array a value, it doesn't have to be the next logical number. 

say we have an array called "c" that we want to populate with: 0, hey, 70, 20
We could, if we wanted, set the indexes for those elements to any value e.g.

c[0]=0
c[3]=hey
c[7]=70
c[2]=20

If we then echoed out all the elements in the array:

echo ${c[@]}                                #input
0 20 hey 70                                 #output

We have no way of telling from this which indexes have been populated.

To find out which indexes have been used in an array we can run:

echo ${!c[@]}                               #input
0 2 3 7                                     #output

This inadvertedly also tells us the largest and smallest indexes that are filled. 

Helpful extras:

If we want to add an extra element to an array we can use the following:
days=(mon tue wed thu fri)                  #array named days, populated with days of the week
days+=(sat sun)                             #add the extra two days to the end of the array
echo ${days[@]}                             #echo all elements of the array
mon tue wed thu fri sat sun                 #output

You can unset elements of an array in the same way you unset variables:
unset <array-name>[index]
e.g. 
unset days[6]                               #removes "sun" from the array

You can unset the entire array in the same way 
unset <array-name>
e.g. 
unset days                                  

It is also worth knowing that the name of the array is also considered index 0. 
So if for example you ran the command "days=SUN" it would overright the index 0 value with SUN
e.g. the new element list would be "SUN tue wed thu fri sat"
This is helpful to know to avoid mistakes, but not likely to be used much in practise, more something to avoid. 



The Cut Command

Often when you have a file output or for example an ls -l, you have too much information and you just want a piece of the info. 
Maybe you're running a script and you need to store a segment of the info so the script can react accordingly. 
We don't want all of the output so we use the cut command. 

Real world example:
Say we have a file named bob.txt that contains the following:

1 line first
abc
ab
a

2 line here
3 line here
4 line


Now say we want the first character of each line, we would run 

cut -c 1 bob.txt                            #input
1                                           #output
a
a
a

2
3
4

Alternatively if we wanted only the 3rd character of each line:

cut -c 3 bob.txt                            #input
l                                           #output
c



l
l
l

We can also cut in ranges, for eaxmple if we wanted characters 1-3:

cut -c 1-3 bob.txt                            #input
1 l                                           #output
abc
ab
a

2 l
3 l
4 l


We can also cut from a certain character to the end of the line:

cut -c 3- bob.txt                             #input
line first                                    #output
c



line here
line here
line


Alternatively if we wanted every character from the start up to the fourth character:

cut -c -4 bob.txt                             #input
1 li                                          #output
abc
ab
a

2 li
3 li
4 li


We can also select multiple specific character:

cut -c 1,3 bob.txt                             #input
1l                                             #output
ac
a
a

2l
3l
4l



We can pipe into cut:

echo "something inside here" | cut -c 2-5       #input
omet                                            #output


We can also redirect into cut:

cut -c 3- <<< " "string redirect :)"            #input
ring redirect :)                                #output


Using -c with cut is extremely useful when you know the character number you want to cut. 
However sometimes you have outputs that aren't fixed in length so you won't know the character number to cut. 
In this case we may want to cut a specific field instead. 
Analysing the same file as above, the fields are each string seperated by a space, therefore the delimiter is space.

Another example, say we have a file named "bob2.txt" that contains the following:

1,line,third,end
abc,def
abc, rob,alex,123
a,gio, mark,p12q
2,line,here,44
3,line,here
4,line

As we can see, in this case the delimeter is "," so if we wanted to cut specific fields, we have to specify the delimeter and that we want to cut specific fields:

cut -d "," -f 1 bob2.txt                        #input, the -d perameter sets the delimeter, the -f specifes that we are looking at fields, the integer tell which specific field to cut
1                                               #output
abc
abc
a
2
3
4

If we wanted the third field then we would:

cut -d "," -f 3 bob2.txt                        #input, the -d perameter sets the delimeter, the -f specifes that we are looking at fields, the integer tell which specific field to cut
third                                           #output

alex
 mark
here
here


Everything we did with the -c character option, we can do here. E.g if we wanted fields 1-3

cut -d "," -f 1-3 bob2.txt                        #input, the -d perameter sets the delimeter, the -f specifes that we are looking at fields, the integer range tells which specific fields to cut
1,line,third                                      #output
abc,def
abc, rob,alex
a,gio, mark
2,line,here
3,line,here
4,line

Or if we wanted everything from the second field onward:

cut -d "," -f 2- bob2.txt                         #input, the -d perameter sets the delimeter, the -f specifes that we are looking at fields, the integer range tells which specific fields to cut
line,third,end                                    #output
def
 rob,alex,123
gio, mark,p12q
line,here,44
line,here
line


If we wanted every field upto field 2 we would run: cut -d "," -f -2 bob2.txt 
If we specifically wanted fields 1 and 4 we would run: cut -d "," -f 1,4 bob2.txt
And as above we can use pipe and redirection with the delimeter option.  




The Stat command

The stat command gives you detailed info about files and folders in your system. 
It is one of the rare exceptions of commands that behave very differently in a linux unix system compared to a mac unix system 

Linux 

stat <file-name>                                #outputs the stat data for a specific file
e.g. 

stat PATH-Script.txt                                                                        #input 
  File: PATH-Script.txt
  Size: 4202      	Blocks: 16         IO Block: 4096   regular file                        #output
Device: 8,2	Inode: 9568297     Links: 1
Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1000/    adam)   Gid: ( 1000/    adam)
Access: 2025-03-12 12:15:14.771977528 +0000
Modify: 2025-03-06 13:33:41.087699774 +0000
Change: 2025-03-06 13:33:41.090699796 +0000
 Birth: 2025-03-06 13:33:41.083699746 +0000

We can utilise the stat command to grab specific information about a file by passing the format parameter

The general form is:

stat --format %Letter <filename>                        #where the letter is specific to a certain type of data 

e.g. say you wanted to pick out the filename, we use "n":

stat --format %n PATH-Script.txt            #input
PATH-Script.txt                             #output

Alternatively, the short form of the above command is:
stat -c %n PATH-Script.txt
Either works fine


Another useful letter is "A" which corresponds to file's permissions:

stat -c %A PATH-Script.txt                  #input
-rw-rw-r--                                  #output

The complete list of letter options can be found running: man stat
(These aren't neccessary to know)

If you are looking for something specific in the manual:

/searchterm e.g. /size will highlight the word size occuring in the manual
If there are multple hits for the search term, use "n" to go to next and "N" for previous

%a     permission bits in octal (note '#' and '0' printf flags)
%A     permission bits and file type in human readable form
%b     number of blocks allocated (see %B)
%B     the size in bytes of each block reported by %b
%C     SELinux security context string
%d     device number in decimal (st_dev)
%D     device number in hex (st_dev)
%Hd    major device number in decimal

%Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
%z     time of last status change, human-readable
%Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch
Valid format sequences for file systems:
%a     free blocks available to non-superuser
%b     total data blocks in file system

--terse --file-system is equivalent to the following FORMAT:
%n %i %l %t %s %S %b %f %a %c %d


As we can see, depending on whether the character is capitalised or not can give us different information
e.g using u vs U will either give you the user ID of the owner of the file or the username of the owner of the file

Additional info: 

The user ID is stored in an environment variable and can be accessed at any time
e.g. echo $UID

Some of the time-related options are "Since Epoch"
Think of this as Unix-time, it is a way of expressing time in seconds since midnight of 01/01/1970.
You can access the current epoch time using:

date +%s
 




Stat command in mac

Stat works similarly but has some key differences.
running "stat PATH-Script.txt" as we did before still spits out information about the file but it is much less readable. 
If you want it to match closely to the way linux works you instead have to run it wit the -x option;

stat -x PATH-Script.txt

In order to select detailed information from a file we use the -f option, the general format is:

stat -f %letter <filename>              #-f is the mac equivilent to --format

e.g. 
stat -f %N PATH-Script.txt              #input
PATH-Script.txt                         #output

The important difference between mac and linux is that is you want a human readable way of interpreting information such as permissions the method is different. 
On linux as we saw we used upper case and lower case to access different formats of the same info e.g %a vs %A
On Mac, not only is the letter different (p), but in order to make it human readable, you have to add S between the % and the letter. 
This basically says "give me the output in a string readable way"
e.g.

stat -f %Sp PATH-Script.txt              #input
-rw-rw-r--                               #output

The addition of the capital S can be used with any of the mac letter options such as user ID vs Username (%u vs %Su), group ID vs groupname (%g vs %Sg) etc 

For more information regarding what command options you have, again check the manual for stat via:

man stat

If you are looking for something specific in the manual:

/searchterm e.g. /size will highlight the word size occuring in the manual
If there are multple hits for the search term, use "n" to go to next and "N" for previous
