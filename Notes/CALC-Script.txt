Arithmetic In Bash

Long story short, basic arithmetic in bash is awful. 
It doesn't work. 
We don't have access to answers with decimal points. 
The syntax is also terrible:
echo $((3 +5))                                      #Prints the answer to 3+5
But it also doesn't really work for division for answers that aren't whole numbers.

Long story short, we have to use a different environment called the bc environment. 

bc                                                  #enters computational environment
