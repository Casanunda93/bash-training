To make a bash script:

create a file
open that file in the text editor of your choice (I prefer VS)
add the line:
    #! /bin/bash            (this says "whatever you find in this file, interpret it with bash) (Not strictly neccessary but good practise to ensure things run smoothly)
 
We then need to change the permissions on the file to make it executable:

chmod +x filename

To run the file we run:
    ./filename
