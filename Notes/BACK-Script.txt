The BACK Script

Repeated use of .. to move back from a folder is inefficient. 
We could write a script to create the command "back #" where # is the number of steps backwards you want to take.

To do so we need to talk about a few concepts.


Subshells

When we open a terminal, we run the initial bash script to open a BASH shell. 
if you run the command "exit" you leave the BASH shell, meaning you cannot do anything else in your terminal

subshells are shells that can be opened from within the initial bash shell. 

bash or /bin/bash                       (opens a subshell)
exit                                    (leaves current shell i.e. if in a subshell, exits that subshell)

You can enter as many subshells as you want 

if you create a file in a subshell, the file still exists in the main shell
However variables set in a subshell are not accessible from the main shell

This is key, as when we create a script, the initial line #! /bin/bash means that the script will run in a subshell. 
This means variables set in the script are not accessible from the main shell. 



The Source Command

source <Script.sh>                      (Forces the specified script to run in the CURRENT shell rather than in a subshell)

By running source, any variables specified in the script are now accessible by the current shell

*** alternative syntax is . <Script.sh> but this is very much frowned upon ***


The Type Command

there are different types of commands:
- executable programs e.g. cat or scripts we write etc
- shell builtins e.d. cd 
- alias e.g. commands we create ourselves

type <command>                          (prints the type description of the specified command to screen, for alias' it also describes the alias)
