The MAX_STRING script


REFRESHER: Pipe

Pipe is used to take the output of command 1 as the input of command 2:

command1 | command 2
e.g. ls folder | less                               (takes the listed contents over folder and pipes it into the less command generating a second screen output)


extra commands:

tail -4 file1.txt                                   (Output the last 4 lines of a specified file to the screen)

so say you have folder 1 containing 5 txt folders 1-5. 

ls folder1 | tail -3                                (Output the last 3 names of files in the folder to the screen i.e. 3.txt, 4.txt and 5.txt)

You can pipe multiple times into multiple commands e.g.

ls folder1 | tail -3 | less                         (Output the last 3 names of files in the folder to a second screen i.e. 3.txt, 4.txt and 5.txt)

ls folder1 | tail -3 | less | sort >  newfile.txt   (Output to a newfile the alphebetically sorted last three filenames of the listed directory contents)
