Every command in the linux system has an exit status. 
The exit status is an integer. 
It is 0 if a command is executed successfully. 
It is non-0 if a command is executed unsuccessfully. 

To access the exit status of a comman we use:
$?
e.g. We run a command that we want to check the ES of, then we run:
echo $?

To access the manual for information about a specific command:
man <command>

Here we can see specific info about Exit statuses

Exit status can be useful for functions within shell scripting.
